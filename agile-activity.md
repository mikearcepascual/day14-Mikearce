1. How to do Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM)?
The purpose of iteration planning is for the team to complete the set of top-ranked product backlog items. This commitment is time boxed based on the length of iteration and team velocity.

Iteration planning involves the Scrum master, who acts as a facilitator for the agile delivery team. Product Owner, who deals with the detailed view of the product backlog and their acceptance criteria, and the Agile Team that defines their tasks and sets the effort estimates required to fulfill the commitment.

The steps involved in iteration planning are as follows:
1. Determine how many stories can fit in an iteration
2. Break these stories into tasks and assign each task to their owners
3. Each task is given estimates in hours
4. These estimates help team members to check how many task hours each member have for the iteration
5. Team members are assigned tasks considering their velocity or capacity so that they are not overburdened.


2. How to do Desk Check (with BA & QA)?
A desk check is when a developer presents a partially or fully finished item or module to the team (testers, analysts, other devs). The objective is to quickly analyze the solution and make any necessary changes without having the code leave the developer's local machine.

Do desk checks as soon as there is any work item that can be presented to others for feedback, and before the developer moves onto another task.

During a typical desk check, the developer brings out team members and demonstrates the solution to them, executing typical usage scenarios that satisfy the requirements and going through any technical details that would be important to the audience.

During the session, a tester or analyst can point out bugs or issues, or they may agree with the developer that the acceptance criteria have been met (at least on the surface). While they're at it, they can perform some exploratory experiments. Other programmers might contribute a test or two or conduct research to better comprehend the system architecture.

3. How to do Dev Kick off (with BA & QA)?
User story kick-offs are short meetings, usually 10â€“15 minutes, that developers initiate to align everyone on the team before they start to code a feature. 

This is a very important discussion that gets all involved parties on the same page in understanding the requirements and the deliverables of the story.

This discussion should be as detailed as possible with the QA(s) trying to identify and share the test scenarios with the BA and the developers. Also, input from the BA and the developers should be taken on any scenarios that may have been missed, or based on the understanding of the code changes involved, if any other scenarios need to be included when testing the story.
